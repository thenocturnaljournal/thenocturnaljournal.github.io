/* These cards are a tribute to Vietnamese 
rapper Suboi. Not quite sure where the 
plagiarism lines are, so I figured I'd 
cite my inspiration. 

The postcards reflect Rice Creative's design 
of Suboi's 2.7 EP (2017). 

The phrases I've used are a type of ancient 
Vietnamese pun (or noi lai).In old literature, 
scholars used noi lai to challenge each other-- 
sorta like a punny rap battle. One person would 
come up with 2 verses on the spot, then the other 
person would reply with 2 homophonic verses. These 
lines would have ironic (and usually humorous) meanings. 

For example, "bat mi bi mat bi mat" translates to 
"spill the secret that got stolen." 
	<!-- bat mi (spill the beans) bi mat (secret)  
	bi mat (got stolen, taken away)  -->
	<!-- dau tien (first off, to begin with) tien dau 
	(whereâ€™s the money)  -->

I chose these elements (Vietnamese, noi lai, and SUBOI) 
for specific reasons:

	1. Most google web fonts aren't suited for every 
	written language. Vietnamese has one of the most 
	complex diacritic systems in the world. I wanted 
	to find and use typefaces that supported these accents.

	2. Ya girl loves puns. 
	Vietnamese puns look even better than English ones
	(and are more sophisticated in craft, which doesn't hurt).

	3. Suboi is the first-- and only-- queen of Vietnamese hip hop. 
	Vietnamese music is only just now starting to incorporate 
	genres like hip hop and dance pop into their industry, and it 
	seems like she was one of the catalysts. Her music isn't the
	best when compared to the production we're used to, but 
	compared to the old folk songs, it's much more innovative and
	expressive.

	4. Vietnam is kind of going through a music 
	crisis right now-- contemporary vs. traditional. 
	Which will win?! Tune in next week to find out more!! 
	Because of the conservative majority tastes, there are a 
	lot of Vietnamese censorship laws that make common topics 
	of rap completely off-limits. No sex. No drugs. No illegal 
	activity. Suboi is dope at using metaphors to get around these 
	censorship laws. How does she do it, you ask? By using old 
	literary techniques like-- you guessed it-- noi lai!! Dude! 
	Can u imagine if kanye rapped in shakespearean english?? 
	would be wild.

	5. Rice Creative is a big branding studio in Vietnam / 
	kinda sorta internationally right now. I love that they're 
	doing so well bc Vietnam doesn't have a reputation for 
	being a design hotspot. Wanna show my love.

tl,dr; basically i think it's cool that there's a badass 
woman in Vietnam making contemporary music better than 
most of her peers and she's doing it while using sophisticated 
literary techniques. 

okay so this started as a citation and is now a mini-essay. 

oops bye
